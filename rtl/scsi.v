//
//     audio status 0x13  =  "play operation completed"

// serves cur_data on any DACK read, dma_ack is gated on the bus phase alone,
// and data_cnt advances on every ACK edge. A BLIND pseudo-DMA pump therefore
// walks straight through the frontier and is handed the ring slot's PREVIOUS
// occupant until the late fill lands: stale head, fresh tail, GOOD status.
// That is the 2026-08-26 CD->disk corruption. The Mac Plus SCSI Manager runs
// exactly such a pump,
// and the Plus has no bus hold-off with which to stop it.
//
// This does NOT stop the pump -- only the CPU hold-off can. It makes the
// breach LOUD: a read that was served unfilled
// sectors ends in CHECK CONDITION instead of GOOD, so the driver retries
// rather than writing garbage to disk and reporting success.
//
// Detection is exact, not heuristic. Inside a read data phase rd_cur_unfilled
// can only RISE as a result of the initiator's own advance across a sector
// boundary (rd_cur_blk = data_cnt[31:9]), and rd_hps_blk only ever grows,
// which clears it. So there is no poll-to-read race: an initiator that honours
// the withdrawn REQ cannot present an ACK while this holds, and a polite
// initiator therefore never trips it.
//
// The condition mirrors io_busy's READ clause term for term -- `mounted`
// included, because media loss mid-READ deliberately does not stall (see
// io_busy) and so is not a frontier breach; it keeps reporting through its own
// path. `data_phase_complete` is added because it too suppresses REQ, so an
// ACK past the transfer length is a DIFFERENT violation and must not be
// reported as this one.
